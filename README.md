### Introduction

Binary trees are fundamental data structures in computer science, often used for tasks like searching, sorting, and hierarchical organization. This repository includes C implementations of binary trees, covering tasks such as creating nodes, traversing trees, and implementing different types of binary trees like Binary Search Trees (BSTs), AVL Trees, and Max Binary Heaps.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **0-binary_tree_node.c:** Implementation of a function to create a binary tree node.
- **binary_tree_print.c:** Utility function for visualizing binary trees.
- **[Other task files]:** Additional files containing implementations for various binary tree-related tasks.

### Compilation

To compile the project, you can use the provided compilation command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c [Task files] -o binary_trees
```

### Usage

You can use the compiled binary to run various tasks or tests:

```bash
./binary_trees
```

### Tasks

The tasks are organized in separate files, each addressing a specific aspect of binary trees. Refer to the task files for details on the implemented functions and their purposes.

- **0-binary_tree_node.c:** Creates a binary tree node..
